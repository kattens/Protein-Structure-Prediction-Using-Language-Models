# Future Work for Protein-Protein Interaction Detection Project

## Overview
This section outlines the future work planned for the project aimed at detecting protein-protein interactions (PPI) using transformer models, specifically focusing on BERT with transfer learning, based on Protein Data Bank (PDB) files.

## Goals
- Adapt a BERT model for PPI detection and identification of spatial relationships in protein structures.
- Implement transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the model on PPI-specific data.
- Develop functionality to identify the 10 closest amino acids in PDB files with different chains.

## Steps for Future Development

### 1. Data Understanding and Preprocessing
- Thoroughly analyze the format of PDB files, focusing on sequences and amino acid coordinates.
- Develop preprocessing pipelines to convert these sequences and coordinates into a model-friendly format.

### 2. Model Adaptation
- Understand BERT's architecture and its applicability to sequence data.
- Modify BERT's output layer to align with the objectives of PPI detection and spatial relationship analysis.

### 3. Transfer Learning
- Fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on the PPI dataset.
- Ensure the model adapts to the specifics of protein sequences and interaction patterns.

### 4. Training and Validation
- Start with basic sequence training, then gradually introduce more complex features.
- Regularly evaluate the model's performance on a validation set to monitor learning progress.

### 5. Spatial Relationship Analysis
- Develop or integrate a method for calculating the proximity of amino acids in protein structures.
- Train the model to identify the 10 closest amino acids in cases of multiple chains.

### 6. Evaluation and Iteration
- Establish robust metrics for evaluating PPI detection accuracy.
- Iteratively refine the model based on performance feedback.

### 7. Challenges and Considerations
- Be prepared for complex data patterns and diverse PPI types.
- Plan for substantial computational resources for training and inference.
- Stay informed on the latest in machine learning and bioinformatics research.
